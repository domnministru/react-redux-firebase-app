This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is made of [React, Redux & Firebase App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4v5uxTY5o&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3)

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br>
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br>
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.<br>

## Problems may appear

`If you are using react-redux v6 a v3.*.* version of react-redux-firebase is required`

Tutorial is made on react-redux@^5.1.1 and react-redux-firebase@^2.2.6. (better keep those).<br>
If you are using later versions, changes are needed to avoid crashes<br>
